#+TITLE: dotfiles

My humble nixos config and dotfiles (still learning nix, be nice >_<)

* What is this exactly?

This repo is basically my dotfiles and a nix playground. rn it has my dotfiles for
- emacs
- hyprland et al
- nvim, foot
- some nix configuration (hopefully, ill finish it all)
- and more

* How may this poor soul install your mighty dotfiles

that's the most basic of all. I still use the non-nix approach to the config.

#+begin_src zsh
  git clone https://github.com/owlenz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles/config 
  ../install.sh
#+end_src

for the nix packages (i am still using configuration.nix, so don't forget to change hostname first)

#+begin_src zsh
  # if not cloned already
  git clone https://github.com/owlenz/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

  ## enable nix-command and flake first in /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch -v --flake .#owlenz
#+end_src

** TODO finish modularizing all of nix
** TODO find some less ugly way to manage the config files
